Repackaging module
(C) Laurent Franceschetti 2014

Changes the default directory for paths, so as to avoid
the relative path.

Use this when you move the file into a subdirectory and don't want
to rewrite the import statements.

If you have:
Parent
   |--a.py
   |--mydir1
   |  |--b.py
   |  |--mydir12
   |     |--c.py
   |--mydir2
      |--d.py

Just dump this module in mydir1 and call:

    import repackage
    repackage.up()

From then on, you can access a.py as if it was in the local directory.


Note:
    If you are in mydir12, the root is 2 levels up, add this call :
        repackage.up(2)

    You can call d.py in the following way:
        mydir2.d


If you are unsure what the situation is, call the lib_path function, which
returns the current path list:
    a = repackage.lib_path()
